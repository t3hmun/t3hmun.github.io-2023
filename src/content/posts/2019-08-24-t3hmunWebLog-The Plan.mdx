## What

This is yet another project to create my own generated website.
My last project of this kind was a Node.JS script for generating a static site suited to github.
Now I'm messing around with .Net Core 3 so I need a reason to create a server.
The vague objectives are:

-   Generate blog posts from md files.
-   Auto update
    -   Use CI/CD to publish the site but not the posts
    -   Use a sub-repo for the posts, auto-update on push
    -   Also publish draft branches to another url
-   Import the pages from my previous sites
-   Do something else

## Approach

I'm not taking the best approach for making a site,
I'm wildly over-engineering everything for the sake of learning, and fun.

In the spirit of agile, I'll make sure I talk to myself regularly to keep up with changing requirements.
