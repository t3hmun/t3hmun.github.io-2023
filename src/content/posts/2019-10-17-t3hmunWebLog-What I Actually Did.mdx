-   Made a simple ASP .net Core 3 site that generates pages from MD
    -   The markdown posts live in a sub-repo
    -   https://github.com/t3hmun/posts
-   Tried to use Azure Pipeline and Azure for build and deployment
    -   Discovered Microsoft don't do Core 3 on Azure / Azure DevOps yet ><
    -   Realised that this is the excuse to learn some docker I needed
-   Shoved it in Docker for build and deployment
    -   BuildWebCompiler isn't linux docker friendly so I dropped it
    -   Replaced it with SassC called as a separate build step in docker
    -   Docker is surprisingly easy
-   Linked docker hub directly to the GitHubRepo
    -   **Docker Hub is now my build server**
    -   Azure pipelines is a waste of space, Docker is the future
    -   https://hub.docker.com/r/t3hmun/t3hmun
-   Told Azure to publish the Docker container
    -   https://t3hmun.azurewebsites.net/
    -   Free tier
    -   It just works, pretty sweet
    -   The cold server start-up is horrific
    -   The page loads are instant _nice_

At this point I was meant to move onto simple ASP caching but I decided that publishing posts needed to be easier.
While struggling with moving parts of using Git for storing, accessing and updating data, I had an epiphany.
That is what databases are for.
**Then I jumped down the rabbit hole of cloud tech.**

In short I'm going to re-write everything as a set of completely decoupled compute functions.
Somehow I'm going to architect it so it isn't tied down to Azure too.
I'll write another article when I know what this actually means.
Sounds totally achievable :)

In the mean time this Azure published site will replace the old site. Primitive but functional.
